# CS345-Assignment3 : A web hi-fi prototype.

This project required us to create a hi-fi prototype for a web interface for a home 'internet of things' control system.

We were only permitted to use html, css or javascript or frameworks of these.  Pre-written templates were not allowed.

  I went into this project knowing only the very basics of html and css and had practically no knowledge of Javascript.
  I spent a lot of time on this assignment and learned a huge amount.  I now feel confident that I understand the interactions
  of web elements, how to manipulate them through css, and how Javascript is used to create dynamic content.

The focus of the project was on design and not so much on complexity of functionality.  My final report is design.pdf.

<h2>Tools implemented in this project: </h2>
  <dl>
    <dt>BOOTSTRAP</dt>
    <dt>BOOTSTRAP TOGGLE</dt>
      <dd>Turns Bootstrap checkboxes into switches. Found here: xxx </dd>
    <dt>BOOTSRAP SLIDER</dt>
      <dd>Implements a range slider</dd>
    <dt>JQUERY</dt>
      <dd>Used to assist with creating the dynamics of the page</dd>
  </dl>
  

  
  I hope you like my design. Constructive criticism appreciated.
  
  Cheers,
  Dane
